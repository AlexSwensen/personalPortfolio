### Welcome to my Portfolio!

## Tools

- HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript
- This website is made from scratch, not using any template but instead drawing inspiration from websites like Dribbble.com. I chose Tailwind CSS as I have already made a portfolio with CSS and wanted to learn a new framework. This website is apart of my learning journey with Tailwind CSS.

## The Process

- Use Headings (h1,h2, and h3) appropriately.
- Before revamping my portfolio, I would use multiple h1s which is not considered best practice.
